# maximum plots may not be shown in GitHub environment because I used plotly library here and GitHub performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesnâ€™t include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a Plotly graph. This is why my Plotly graphs are not visible when I upload my Jupyter notebook to GitHub. So don't worry, my code will definitely run into your system. All you have to install plotly library.

Thank you see you later
